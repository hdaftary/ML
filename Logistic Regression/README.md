Implemented Logistic Regression using Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD).
Logistic regression minimizes the negative average conditional log likelihood.
To minimize this loss function, we will use gradient descent.

In the project, I have trained a Logistic Regression model to predict whether a patient will recover from COVID-19. The dataset contains real data from
patients that were diagnosed with COVID-19. For each patient, it includes a number of features, including
age, gender, blood pressure and other lab results collected at the admission time. All these are the features that
can be used in order to forecast if a patient is likely to recover or not.
